# MentorLink

MentorLink is a Spring Bootâ€“based web application designed to manage mentorship and internship programs. It allows administrators to allocate projects to mentors, retrieve mentor information based on their workload, update project assignments, and remove projects as needed.

## Purpose

This project was inspired by my recent experience mentoring young developers at a summer coding camp focused on web development and STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). MentorLink is built to simulate a real-world platform that helps manage mentor-intern relationships efficiently.

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.2.x
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- RESTful API
- Maven
- Jakarta Bean Validation

## Features

- Allocate a new project to a mentor (with constraint on max projects per mentor)
- Retrieve mentors by number of projects mentored

## Status
